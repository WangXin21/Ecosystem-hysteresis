# Ecosystem-hysteresis

## Introduction
Ecosystem-hysteresis is a Python toolkit for simulating and analyzing Hysteresis phenomena in ecosystems. Hysteresis is a common feature of ecosystems, describing the non-immediate response and path dependence of the system state to changes in driving factors. This project offers functions such as quantification of hysteresis intensity, data fitting, and trend prediction, aiming to help ecologists better understand the resilience and stability of ecosystems.
## Main functions
- **Hysteresis Intensity Estimation** : Quantifying the intensity of hysteresis phenomena in an ecosystem through mathematical models.
- **Data Fitting** : Multiple fitting methods are provided to simulate hysteresis loops in ecological data.
- **Trend Prediction** : Predict the future changing trends of the ecosystem state based on historical data.
## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language** : Python 3.9
- **Python software packages** :
  - **numpy** : used for numerical computation.
  - **pandas** : used for data processing and analysis.
  - **matplotlib** : Used for data visualization and result plotting.
  - **os** : Used for file path operations and system interactions.
